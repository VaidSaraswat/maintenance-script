# maintenance-script
This script was developed at Prodigy Education. The aim of this script was to toggle the weights of various alias records in AWS Route53 such that
they would route to maintenance CDN to enable "maintenance-mode". Once the maintenance was done, one would simply run the script again to deactivate "maintenance mode"
